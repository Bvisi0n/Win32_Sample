# Win32_Sample

This is a practice project developed in preparation for my Programming 3 exam. 

**Note:** This is a personal study project created for exam prep and is not an official school assignment.

At the time of writing this (December 2025), I am a second-year student in the **Game Development** major of the **Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE)** bachelor’s program at **Howest** in Kortrijk, Belgium. This repository serves as a practical application of the Win32 API and C++ concepts covered in the curriculum.

Due to the study nature of this project there is an unnecessary amount of comments describing the code, these are essentially my notes.

## Project Details
* **Course:** Programming 3
* **Context:** Independent Exam Preparation
* **Technologies:** C++, Win32 API
